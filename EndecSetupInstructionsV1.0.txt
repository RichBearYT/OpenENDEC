--------------- HARDWARE SETUP ---------------

First we want to set the type of device the endec will be outputing to.

---

From the frount panel, go to:

MENU > DEVICES > COM2 (CHOSE ANY COM PORT YOU WANT TO USE) > DEVICE TYPE > NEWSFEED > (Press enter, then enter the admin passcode)

---

Then set the Baud Rate by going to:

MENU > DEVICES > COM2 (CHOSE THE COM PORT YOUR USING IN STEP 1) > DEVICE TYPE > BAUD RATE > 9600 > (Press enter, then enter the admin passcode)

Now the ENDEC is setup!

---------------
You need to make a cable that goes to the COM Port that you chose, to the PC's serial input. 

(NOTE: If you dont have a serial port on your computer, you can buy an 'RS-232 to USB' adapter.)

The cable is a standerd NULL MODEM CABLE.
Each side of the cable is a male DB-9 connector.
Pins 2 & 3 are swaped from each end of the cable.

 Pinout
 1 - 1
 2 - 3
 3 - 2
 4 - 4
 5 - 5
 6 - 6
 7 - 7
 8 - 8

(NOTE: Leave pin 9 disconected, it have accesery power that could fry the PC COM port!)




--------------- SOFTWARE SETUP ---------------

First Install Python

Download the endec.py script from the github page.

Edit the script using an editor. (Python or Notepad will work just fine)

Go to device manager and find what com port your using on your PC.
Findthe example line below and change the value between the quotes to the com port your using, in the example below, were using "COM1" on the PC.

device = "COM1"

On the line below change the value between the quotes to the webhook link your using. (This script will make a POST request to the given link)

webhook = "webhook url goes here"


Now SAVE and EXIT the python script.

---

Go to the endec.py script and run it.

Make your ENDEC send a weekily test and if it comes through, your done!!!
